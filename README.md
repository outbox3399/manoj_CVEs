Now, go to terminal and cd to the project and start the server by typing `python manage.py runserver`. This will start the server and give the `localhost` URL as `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

Open this URL in browser and append /hello there (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello`). This will show page with test "hello world !"

Now, remove `/hello` and append `//udemy.com` and this should redirect you to `udemy.com` home page.
